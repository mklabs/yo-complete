# yo-complete

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mklabs/yo-complete.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mklabs/yo-complete)

This package is a work in progress package to add completion for Yeoman as a
separate repository.

It'll help in figuring out the best way to integrate with Yeoman.

## Installation

        npm install --save mklabs/yo-complete#master --global

Then, you'll need to run

        yo-complete completion

It'll ask for your approval to add the necessary lines to either `~/.bashrc`,
`~/.zshrc` or `~/.config/fish/config`

## Note

This is a work in progress package, and will remain on github (no npm publish).
It serve as a playground to develop the `3.0.0` version of tabtab.
